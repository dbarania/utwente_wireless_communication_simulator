# Smart home management simulator

#### Created as a part of Wireless Communication project at the University of Twente in December 2024

## Assumptions about the system

1. Time is represented using discrete time units
2. Data size is represented as an integer
3. Bandwidth is represented as amount of data units transferred to server in a time unit
4. CPU performance is represented as maximum amount operations performed in a time unit
5. There is a data delay between IoT hub and servers represented in time units, data will start arriving at the server
   after this delay
